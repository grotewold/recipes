Soft Corn Tortillas
===================
When It comes to tacos, our family prefers soft, corn tortillas over flour or hard shell. 

Ingredients
-----------
* paper towels
* 1 cup vegetable oil
* package corn tortillas

Directions
----------
Fill a small frying pan with vegetable oil about half an inch deep. Heat oil on stovetop with medium heat. Place one tortilla in pan after oil has had time to heat up. After 6-8 seconds in the oil flip the tortilla and count another 6-8 seconds. Remove tortilla from oil and place on a paper towel. Repeat for the remaining tortillas. You should be able to fit 2 tortillas per paper towel. Cover the tortillas with the paper towel for the next tortillas. Great for chicken tacos!
