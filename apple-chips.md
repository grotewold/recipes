Apple Chips
===========

Ingredients
-----------

*   1 apple (any kind will do, I think)
*   1 tsp sugar
*   1 tsp ground cinnamon

Directions
----------

Preheat oven to 225. Stir cinnamon and sugar together. Slice your apples
extremely thin horizontally. This is best done with a mandolin slicer but I do
it with just a sharp knife and steady hand. Place side by side on aluminium
foil line cookie sheet pans. Make sure not to overlap the apple slices.
Sprinkle apple slices with cinnamon sugar. Bake for 1 hour, remove from the
oven, and flip them. Sprinkle other side with cinnamon sugar and return the
apple slices to the oven for 1 hour more. Let apple chips cool completely in
oven.
