Taco Chicken Bowls
==================

Ingredients
-----------

*   1.5 lbs chicken breasts
*   1 pint salsa
*   1 can black beans, drained
*   1/2 lbs frozen corn
*   1 Tbsp chili powder
*   1/2 Tbsp cumin
*   1/2 Tbsp minced garlic
*   1/2 tsp dried oregano
*   1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
*   1/4 tsp salt
*   1/4 cracked pepper
*   2 cups dry rice
*   8 oz. shredded cheddar
*   _optional_: 1/2 bunch cilantro

Directions
----------

Add everything except the rice, cheese, and cilantro to the slow cooker along
with Â¼ cup of water (for good measure). Give everything a good stir and make
sure the chicken is covered in the mixture. Secure the lid on your slow cooker
and cook on low for 8 hrs. Near the end of the cooking time, cook the two cups
of rice according to the package directions (Bring the rice and 3 cups of water
to a boil in a medium pot with a lid in place, as soon as it reaches a
boil, reduced the heat to low and let simmer for 20 minutes. Fluff with a
fork before serving). After 8 hours of cooking, carefully remove the lid
of the slow cooker. Stir with a fork to shred the chicken (it should be
super tender and will shred easily). Build the taco bowls by placing
rice on the bottom, then the taco chicken mix, shredded cheese and
fresh cilantro.
